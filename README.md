# HoneyProduction
Honey production has been in decline since 1998. I use a simple linear regression model to predict what honey production would look like by the year 2050.
Columns:
  numcol: Number of honey producing colonies. Honey producing colonies are the maximum number of colonies from which honey was            taken during the year. It is possible to take honey from colonies which did not survive the entire year
  yieldpercol: Honey yield per colony. Unit is pounds
  totalprod: Total production (numcol x yieldpercol). Unit is pounds
  stocks: Refers to stocks held by producers. Unit is pounds
  priceperlb: Refers to average price per pound based on expanded sales. Unit is dollars.
  prodvalue: Value of production (totalprod x priceperlb). Unit is dollars.
